In this project, I am showing you a dataset I have scraped from a webpage, which
deals with NBA 2K20 game and its NBA players stats. 

The script I wrote for the web-scraping is nba2k20-scraping.py.

This dataset  contains more than  1000 different  players and  60 columns  which 
contain  different  information   about  all  these  players.   I  explain  some 
characteristics of this dataset in nba-2k20-ratings.html file. 

Finally, I have developed a simple Shiny app  to allow the dinamic visualization
of the distribution  of values in each  numerical variable.  Somehow, the app is
not working remotely, so I will try to fix this in the following days.

I hope you enjoy this project!
